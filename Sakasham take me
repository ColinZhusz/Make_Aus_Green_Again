# Hello, My friend. Nice to meet you. I am a security member in Saksham's team. 
#There is a problem for our project. All the configuration is folowed nginx configuration document,
# and DNS sercice is working for our domain. 
# When we put our domain name, it shows '400 bad request', However public ip address could get into it. The following 
# is the login details for our AWS instance, it is a ubuntu 18.04 version. And webserver is nginx installed.

1.download the private key, it should be Kevinkey.pem and put in in Desktop and cd Desktop

2.then type command 
ssh -i "KevinKey.pem" ubuntu@ec2-52-15-69-68.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

3. you should now get into aws console, then we need to get into virtual environment,
type command  source /env/bin/activate

4. now there should be a (env) before server name

5. our configuration file for nginx is in this path
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/django.conf

6.you can use sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/django.conf to edit that

7. you could see in server name part, I already put three items.
one is our ip address, another two is two domain we have applied.


#Saksham has redirected for our website from makeaustralia.green to our public ip address 52.15.69.68
#it works now. But still, it is not what DNS working right =_=.
#Thank you for helping us.
